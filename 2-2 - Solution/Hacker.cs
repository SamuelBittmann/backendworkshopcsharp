Exercise 2
----------

Oh no, it looks like a hacker has bypassed the security systems of an accounting system and uses 
vulnerabilities in order to steal funds. Fix the issues by setting appropriate access levels and 
ensure the security features that are present in the BankAccount class cannot be circumvented.

There also seems to be a second problem. A developer has accidently inserted a bug which leads the
account holders name to be overwritten in certain cases. Make it impossible to overwrite the inital
value.
